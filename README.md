# README By Laila Ayala

### Page Descriptions:

##### Index Page
      - My Index page is the first thing that people see when they open my site. It has sale information, category images (for things we sell), and a quote to emphasize our mission of happiness. I also included my logo and a side navigation bar for users to be able to move around pages freely. 

##### About Page
      - My About page is a page all about who we are as a company, what our values are, and what our mission is. In this page, I not only explain what the name of the site means in English, but also how it relates to our goals. 

##### Hours Page
       - My Hours page is a page that displays our location and hours. It uses a Bootstrap Grid to show all time slots in correspondence with their days, and is clearly legible to the user.

##### Women's Page
      - My Women's page is a page that displays all women's items we have for sale. It includes clothing like dresses, pants, shirts, etc. 

##### Men's Page
      - My Men's page is a page that displays all men's items that we have for sale. It includes clothing like sweaters, pants, shirts, etc. 

##### Home Good's Page
      - My Home Good's page is a page that displays all home good items that we have for sale. It includes things like boookshelfs, jewelry trays, candles, etc. 

### My Experience:

##### My Experience With Bootstrap
    - Overall, my experience with bootstrap in my code was pretty good. It made coding a lot easier because I had certain things like cards, navbars, etc. already pre-made. The only thing that I didn't really like about using Bootstrap for this was that figuring out styling and whether or not I had to do it through CSS or HTML was incredibly frustrating at times. Other than that though, I really did enjoy using Bootstrap. 

##### My Experience With Planning
      - Planning affected my coding experience in a prety big way. I feel like by planning I was able to set goals for myself and make clear what expectations I had for myself. I believe that planning is key to having a good result and that was no different with this project. Planning made my coding experience very enjoyable and productive, and I look forward to continuing to plan my work in the future. 

### Feature Reflection:

##### The Features I'm Most Proud Of
      - If I had to pick, I'd say that the feature that I'm most proud of is my navigation bar. I really like my navigation bar because not only is it color coordinated and super neat, but it also includes a logo that I made myself. I wanted to have some unique aspect to my project, and so I feel that having a navbar like mine that's not only neat, but also includes a logo image I made myself is super cool. 

##### If I Had More Time
      - If I had more time, I'd probably add more pages for the actual products and responsivness. Because while I did meet most requirements of the rubric, I didn't add much responsiveness, or give users the ability to click on a product and learn more about it. I think overall my project came out pretty good, but I think I would focus more on adding specifics like that to make it even better.
